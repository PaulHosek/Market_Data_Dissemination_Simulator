# Market Data Dissemination Simulator Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development of a high-performance Market Data Dissemination Simulator in C++. The project is divided into three stages: Architectural Design, Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and Beyond MVP.
## Stage 1: Architectural Design
Objective: Define a robust, scalable, and low-latency architecture.

### Tasks:
1. **Requirements Analysis**:
   - Define core functionality: Simulate market data generation, dissemination, and consumption.
   - Support high-throughput market data (e.g., 1M+ messages/sec) with microsecond latency.
   - Handle multiple asset classes (e.g., equities, options) and data types (e.g., quotes, trades).
   - Ensure thread-safety, scalability, and fault tolerance.

2. **System Components**:
   - **Market Data Generator**: Produces synthetic market data (e.g., order book updates, trades) with configurable patterns (e.g., random, bursty).
   - **Dissemination Engine**: Distributes data to subscribers with minimal latency using multicast or TCP/UDP.
   - **Subscriber Interface**: Allows clients to subscribe to specific instruments or data types.
   - **Performance Monitor**: Tracks latency, throughput, and jitter with nanosecond precision.
   - **Configuration Module**: Supports runtime configuration (e.g., message rates, network settings).

3. **Technology Choices**:
   - **Language**: C++23 for modern features (e.g., concepts, modules) and performance.
   - **Networking**: ZeroMQ or custom UDP/multicast for low-latency communication.
   - **Data Structures**: Lock-free queues (e.g., Boost.Lockfree or custom) for inter-thread communication.
   - **Memory Management**: Custom allocators (e.g., jemalloc, slab allocators) to minimize allocation latency.
   - **Logging**: High-performance logging (e.g., spdlog) with minimal overhead.
   - **Testing**: Google Test for unit tests; custom stress tests for performance.

4. **Design Principles**:
   - **Low Latency**: Minimize context switches, use cache-friendly data structures, and avoid dynamic allocations in hot paths.
   - **Scalability**: Support multi-core processing with thread affinity and NUMA awareness.
   - **Modularity**: Design components to be independently testable and replaceable.
   - **Extensibility**: Allow easy addition of new data types or protocols.

5. **Deliverables**:
   - Architecture document with component diagrams and data flow.
   - Performance model estimating throughput and latency targets.
   - Initial project setup (CMake, dependencies, CI/CD pipeline).

## Stage 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Objective: Build a functional prototype demonstrating core low-latency dissemination with measurable performance.

### Tasks:
1. **Core Implementation**:
   - **Market Data Generator**:
     - Generate synthetic quote and trade messages for a single asset class (e.g., equities).
     - Use a simple random walk model for price updates.
     - Configurable message rate (e.g., 10K–100K messages/sec).
   - **Dissemination Engine**:
     - Implement UDP-based multicast for data distribution.
     - Use a single-threaded event loop for simplicity.
     - Serialize messages in a compact binary format (e.g., custom struct or FlatBuffers).
   - **Subscriber Interface**:
     - Basic TCP-based client to subscribe and receive data.
     - Simple filtering by instrument or message type.
   - **Performance Monitor**:
     - Measure end-to-end latency using std::chrono or rdtsc.
     - Log basic metrics (e.g., average latency, throughput).

2. **Optimizations**:
   - Use lock-free queues for data handoff between generator and dissemination engine.
   - Pin threads to cores to reduce context switching.
   - Optimize memory layout for cache efficiency (e.g., struct padding, alignment).

3. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for each component (e.g., data generator produces valid messages).
   - Stress test with 100K messages/sec to measure latency and throughput.
   - Validate no packet loss in dissemination under load.

4. **Deliverables**:
   - Working MVP with a single asset class and basic dissemination.
   - Performance report with latency and throughput metrics (e.g., 99th percentile latency < 10µs).
   - Source code with documentation and tests.
   - Demo showing data generation, dissemination, and subscription.

## Stage 3: Beyond MVP
Objective: Enhance the simulator to more realistic application, focusing on advanced low-latency techniques and scalability.

### Tasks:
1. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - **Market Data Generator**:
     - Support multiple asset classes (e.g., options, futures) with realistic market dynamics (e.g., volatility clustering).
     - Add bursty traffic patterns to simulate market events.
   - **Dissemination Engine**:
     - Implement reliable multicast with retransmission for lost packets.
     - Support multiple dissemination protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, shared memory for co-located clients).
     - Scale to multi-threaded or multi-process architecture with NUMA optimization.
   - **Subscriber Interface**:
     - Add advanced filtering (e.g., by price range, volume).
     - Implement a high-performance client library in C++ for easy integration.
   - **Configuration Module**:
     - Support dynamic reconfiguration (e.g., change message rates without restart).
     - Add JSON or YAML-based configuration files.

2. **Advanced Optimizations**:
   - Use custom memory allocators to eliminate allocation latency in hot paths.
   - Implement kernel bypass (e.g., DPDK or Solarflare) for network I/O.
   - Optimize for cache coherence with data-oriented design.
   - Use SIMD instructions for batch processing of messages.

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Add real-time telemetry with nanosecond-precision latency histograms.
   - Integrate with tools like Grafana or Prometheus for visualization.
   - Measure jitter and tail latency under extreme loads (e.g., 5M messages/sec).

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Simulate real-world scenarios (e.g., market open/close, flash crashes).
   - Benchmark against industry standards (e.g., STAC-T0 for latency).
   - Add fault injection tests (e.g., packet loss, subscriber crashes).
   - Profile with tools like perf or VTune to identify bottlenecks.

5. **Documentation and Showcasing**:
   - Write detailed documentation covering architecture, optimizations, and performance results.
   - Create a presentation or blog post explaining design choices and trade-offs.
   - Package the project as a portfolio piece with a README for recruiters.

6. **Deliverables**:
   - Production-grade simulator handling 5M+ messages/sec with sub-microsecond latency.
   - Comprehensive performance report comparing against industry benchmarks.
   - Fully documented codebase with extensive tests.
   - Demo video or live presentation for interviews.
