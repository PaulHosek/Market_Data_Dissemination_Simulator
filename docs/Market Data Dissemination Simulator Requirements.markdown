# Market Data Dissemination Simulator Requirements

## 1. Overview
The Market Data Dissemination Simulator is a high-performance C++ application designed to simulate the generation, dissemination, and consumption of market data in a low-latency environment. 

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Market Data Generation
- Generate synthetic market data for equities (MVP), with extensibility for options and futures (Beyond MVP).
- Support data types: quotes (bid/ask prices and sizes) and trades (price, volume, timestamp).
- Allow configurable message rates: 10K–100K messages/sec for MVP, scaling to 5M+ messages/sec for Beyond MVP.
- Provide realistic data patterns: random walk for MVP, with bursty traffic and volatility clustering for Beyond MVP.
- Ensure data consistency: Valid price/volume ranges, no negative values.

### 2.2 Data Dissemination
- Distribute market data to subscribers with minimal latency (<10µs for MVP, sub-microsecond for Beyond MVP).
- Use UDP multicast for MVP; support reliable multicast in Beyond MVP.
- Handle multiple subscribers (up to 100 for MVP) with no performance degradation.
- Support message filtering by instrument or data type (e.g., quotes only, specific symbols).
- Ensure no data loss under normal conditions; provide retransmission for Beyond MVP.

### 2.3 Subscriber Interface
- Provide a TCP-based client interface for subscribing to market data (MVP).
- Allow subscriptions to specific instruments or data types.
- Support at least 100 concurrent subscribers with consistent latency.
- Plan for a high-performance C++ client library in Beyond MVP.

### 2.4 Performance Monitoring
- Measure end-to-end latency (from generation to subscriber receipt) with nanosecond precision.
- Track throughput (messages/sec) and jitter (latency variance).
- Log metrics to a file with minimal performance impact (using spdlog or similar).
- Support real-time telemetry (e.g., latency histograms) in Beyond MVP.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
- **Latency**: Achieve <10µs average latency for MVP; target sub-microsecond for Beyond MVP under 1M+ messages/sec load.
- **Throughput**: Handle 100K messages/sec for MVP, scaling to 5M+ messages/sec for Beyond MVP.
- **Scalability**: Support multi-core processing and scale to 100+ subscribers.
- **Reliability**: No crashes or data loss under normal load; graceful degradation under extreme load.

### 3.2 Technical Constraints
- **Language**: C++23 
- **Platform**: Windows 11 for development and testing.
- **Dependencies**: Minimize external libraries; use ZeroMQ (networking), Boost.Lockfree (queues), spdlog (logging), and Google Test (testing) for MVP.
- **Build System**: CMake & Vcpkg

### 3.3 Design Principles
- **Low Latency**: Use lock-free data structures, cache-friendly memory layouts, and avoid dynamic allocations in hot paths.
- **Modularity**: Design components (generator, disseminator, subscriber) to be independently testable and replaceable.
- **Extensibility**: Allow easy addition of new data types or protocols.
- **Maintainability**: Include clear documentation and comprehensive unit tests.

## 4. Edge Cases and Fault Tolerance
- Handle packet loss in dissemination (log for MVP, retransmit for Beyond MVP).
- Manage subscriber failures (e.g., dropped connections) without impacting other subscribers.
- Support bursty traffic (e.g., 10x normal rate for short periods) without crashes.
- Ensure thread-safety for multi-threaded components in Beyond MVP.

## 5. Beyond MVP Focus
Possible extensions to the MVP:
- **Scalable Architecture**: Implement multi-threaded dissemination engine with NUMA-aware design to handle 5M+ messages/sec across multiple cores.
- **Advanced Low-Latency Techniques**:
  - Use custom memory allocators (e.g., jemalloc) to eliminate allocation latency.
  - Implement kernel bypass (e.g., DPDK) for network I/O to achieve sub-microsecond latency.
  - Optimize hot paths with SIMD instructions for batch message processing.
- **Reliable Multicast**: Add retransmission for lost packets to ensure data integrity under high load.
- **High-Performance Client Library**: Develop a C++ library for subscribers, optimized for low-latency data consumption.
- **Real-Time Telemetry**: Provide nanosecond-precision latency histograms and throughput metrics, exportable to tools like Prometheus.
- **Stress Testing**: Simulate extreme market conditions (e.g., flash crashes, 10M messages/sec bursts) and benchmark against industry standards (e.g., STAC-T0).

## 6. Success Criteria
Goal of this project is learning. Here some ambitious targets for the finished product.
- **MVP**: Functional simulator handling 100K messages/sec with <10µs latency, supporting 100 subscribers.
- **Beyond MVP**: Production-grade system handling 5M+ messages/sec with sub-microsecond latency, demonstrating kernel bypass, custom allocators, and reliable multicast.

## 7. Assumptions
- Each message is ~1KB (e.g., quote with symbol, bid/ask prices, sizes, timestamp).
- Development environment has a multi-core CPU and high-speed NIC.
- Network infrastructure supports multicast without significant packet loss.

## 8. Out of Scope (MVP)
- Real market data feeds (use synthetic data only).
- Advanced security (e.g., encryption, authentication).
- GUI for monitoring (use logs and command-line tools for MVP).
